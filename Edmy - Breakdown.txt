EdLight Academy - Online Learning PlatformI'll help you design a comprehensive online learning platform for Haitian students. Based on your Physics NSI curriculum and Khan Academy-inspired approach, here's a detailed implementation plan:Platform Architecture OverviewCore Features1. User Authentication & Profiles? Student registration/login? Progress tracking dashboard? Achievement badges and certificates2. Course Structure? Multi-level hierarchy: Subject ? Class Level ? Units ? Videos ? Quizzes? Physics NSI curriculum already mapped (10 units, 40+ videos)? Similar structure for Math, Chemistry, Economics3. Learning Experience? YouTube video integration? Perseus-powered quizzes after each video? Chapter exams (also Perseus-powered)? Progress tracking with visual indicators4. Exam Prep Module? Seasonal review classes near national exams? Past exam practice sessions? Live or recorded teacher-led reviewsTechnical Stack RecommendationFrontend:? React.js or Next.js for responsive interface? Tailwind CSS for Haitian-friendly, mobile-first design? Perseus framework integration for exercisesBackend:? Node.js with Express or Python with Django/Flask? PostgreSQL for user data and progress tracking? Redis for session managementVideo Hosting:? YouTube API integration for your channel? Embed videos with tracking capabilitiesAuthentication:? JWT tokens or OAuth2? Optional: Social login (Google, Facebook)Key Implementation Considerations1. Bilingual SupportYour Physics curriculum uses Haitian Creole with French scientific terms - this is excellent! Ensure:? UI available in both Creole and French? Video titles/descriptions in Creole? Quiz questions support both languages? Scientific terminology consistently shows French in parentheses2. Perseus IntegrationPerseus (Khan Academy's exercise framework) needs:? Self-hosted Perseus renderer? Custom exercise creation interface for teachers? JSON-based exercise storage? Immediate feedback system? Hint system for struggling students3. Progress TrackingTrack these metrics:? Videos watched (% completion)? Quiz scores and attempts? Time spent per unit? Mastery levels (Not Started ? In Progress ? Proficient ? Mastered)? Streak tracking for engagement4. Mobile OptimizationCritical for Haiti's context:? Responsive design (many students use phones)? Low-bandwidth mode option? Offline capability for downloaded content? Data usage indicatorsDetailed Feature BreakdownStudent Dashboard?- Welcome message: "Byenveni, [Student Name]!"- Current course progress cards- Upcoming review sessions- Recent achievements- Study streak counter- Recommended next lesson?Course Navigation?Physics NSI Example:?? Inite 1: Entwodiksyon nan Fizik   ?? Video 1: Ki sa Fizik ye? [15:23]   ?  ?? Quiz (5 questions) ?   ?? Video 2: Met˜d Syantifik [12:45]   ?  ?? Quiz (5 questions) ?   ?? Chapter Exam (15 questions) ???Quiz/Exam Experience? Perseus renderer for interactive problems? Mix of question types:? Multiple choice? True/False? Fill-in-the-blank? Numeric input? Matching? Immediate feedback? Option to retry (with slight point deduction)? Explanation for correct answersReview Class Module? Calendar of upcoming sessions? Topic: "Revizyon Egzamen Nasyonal - Fizik"? Live stream integration (YouTube Live) or uploaded recordings? Past exam papers available as PDFs? Practice problems from previous years? Teacher-led worked solutionsSample Database Schema?-- Usersusers (id, email, password_hash, full_name, class_level, created_at)-- Coursescourses (id, name, subject, class_level, description)units (id, course_id, unit_number, title, description)videos (id, unit_id, title, youtube_id, duration, order)-- Assessmentsquizzes (id, video_id, perseus_exercise_id, passing_score)exams (id, unit_id, perseus_exercise_id, passing_score, duration)-- Progressvideo_progress (user_id, video_id, completed, watch_time, completed_at)quiz_attempts (user_id, quiz_id, score, attempt_number, completed_at)exam_attempts (user_id, exam_id, score, attempt_number, completed_at)-- Review Classesreview_sessions (id, title, subject, exam_type, session_date, youtube_id)session_attendance (user_id, session_id, attended_at)?User Journey ExampleNew Student - First Week:1. Sign up ? Choose class level (NSI)2. Browse subjects ? Select Physics NSI3. Start Unit 1 ? Watch "Ki sa Fizik ye?"4. Complete quiz ? Score 4/5 (80%)5. Continue ? Video 2 unlocked6. Finish Unit 1 ? Take chapter exam7. Pass exam ? Unit 2 unlocked + Badge earned8. Dashboard ? See 12% progress in PhysicsReturning Student - Exam Prep:1. Login ? See notification: "Revizyon Egzamen Nasyonal - 2 jou rete"2. Join review ? Live session with teacher3. Practice ? Complete past exam 20234. Review ? Watch solution videos5. Ready ? Confidence boost for national examImplementation PhasesPhase 1: MVP (3-4 months)? Basic authentication? Course structure (Physics NSI only)? YouTube video embedding? Simple quizzes (not Perseus yet)? Basic progress trackingPhase 2: Enhanced Learning (2-3 months)? Perseus integration? Full quiz/exam system? All 4 subjects added? Progress analytics? Achievement systemPhase 3: Community & Live (2-3 months)? Review class module? Live session integration? Discussion forums? Teacher dashboard? Parent/guardian portalPhase 4: Advanced Features (Ongoing)? AI-powered recommendations? Peer study groups? Mobile apps (iOS/Android)? Offline mode? Gamification enhancementsContent Creation WorkflowFor your teachers creating Physics videos:1. Script from curriculum (already done!)2. Record video in Creole (6-10 min each)3. Upload to YouTube with metadata4. Create Perseus quiz (5 questions)5. Add to platform via admin dashboard6. Review & publishMonetization Considerations (Optional)? Free tier: Basic access to all videos? Premium: Quizzes, exams, certificates, progress tracking? School licenses: Bulk access for institutions? Sponsorships: Partner with NGOs/education orgs in HaitiAccessibility & Inclusivity? Support for students with disabilities? Screen reader compatibility? Adjustable text sizes? Keyboard navigation? Color-blind friendly design? Low-literacy mode (more visual)Next StepsWould you like me to:1. Create a detailed technical specification document2. Design the database schema in full3. Build a prototype/mockup of key screens4. Write the initial React components5. Set up Perseus integration guide6. Create a content management system for teachersI can also create a working prototype to demonstrate the core functionality. Which aspect would you like me to focus on first?
